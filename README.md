# stamp.exe

This program is for windows only.

When you run this program, the strings based on the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second when it is executed is copied to the clipboard. Then, you can paste it into the text area to generate a different string each time.

yymmdd-hhmmss

With the e option at runtime, a simple encryption will be applied to the string.

I use this program to assign order numbers at work, especially when there are no specific rules for order numbers. With this, the order number is 13 characters long, which is a bit long.
